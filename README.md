# React Native FlatList renderItem returns null or undefined

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug in React Native's FlatList component.  The `renderItem` function, responsible for rendering each item in the list, intermittently returns `null` or `undefined`, resulting in a blank screen or unpredictable rendering behavior.  The issue is exacerbated by asynchronous data fetching and complex rendering logic.

This example includes both the problematic code (`bug.js`) and a solution (`bugSolution.js`) showcasing how to mitigate this issue using proper error handling and conditional rendering.
